# Safety eDISH Overview

Evaluation of Drug-Induced Serious Hepatotoxicity, or eDISH, plots are a key tool used to assess liver toxicity in clinical trials. This library contains a web-based implementation of the traditional eDISH plot that allows a user to interactively explore participant data in ways that are not possible in static plots. 

## Primary View

Just like the standard eDish plot, the primary view in this library shows one point per participant with maximal ALT and TB over the course of the study shown on the x and y axes as shown below. Features of the interactive chart are annotated and listed below.
